# Parent Scheduling System - Teachers:
### link to a website: https://ronisho.github.io/Web-FinalProject/
The site describes a system for coordinating parent-teacher meetings. Parents enter using their child's full name and thus reveal to them a table with the teachers' names, the subjects they teach and the relevant hours for coordinating a meeting.
Teachers also enter with their full name, thus revealing to them a table with the names of students and the times parents chose for the meeting.

Operating Instructions:
- Parents:
    1. Identify on the login screen with your child's full name.
    2. The meeting system is now exposed to you.
    3. The row above shows the names of the teachers and the subjects they teach.
    4. The red colored box indicates that the time was taken by another student's parents.
    5. You need to choose a white tile, when it suits you and click on it.
    6. Now the tile is painted green - which means it was caught by you.
    7. If you want to change the hour for the same teacher, you must tap the green tile and confirm the deletion. You can then choose another brick slot again.
    8. Note that it is not possible to select the same hour for several teachers.
    9. Good luck!
- Teachers:
    1. Identify on the login screen with your full name.
    2. A two-column table is now revealed to you. First Column - The Hours, Second Column - The names of the students who scheduled an hourly meeting in the first column.
